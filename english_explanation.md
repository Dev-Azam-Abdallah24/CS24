# Explanation of AI Lectures and Exam Pattern

## Introduction

Based on the analysis of the three provided lectures (Introduction to AI, AI Agents, AI Search) and the Mid-term Exam 2024 file, we can deduce the instructor's thinking pattern and question formulation style. The instructor heavily focuses on understanding core concepts and definitions, the ability to apply these concepts in practical scenarios, and a deep understanding of how algorithms work and their properties. It was also noted that some concepts in the exam were not directly covered in the provided lectures, indicating that the instructor might expect students to conduct self-research or that these lectures are part of a broader curriculum.

This explanation aims to elaborate on these points in detail, linking each concept to the relevant lectures and how it might appear in exam questions.

## Instructor's Thinking Pattern and Question Formulation

The instructor's thinking pattern and question formulation can be summarized as follows:

### 1. Focus on Core Concepts and Definitions (Fill-in-the-Blank Questions)

The instructor pays particular attention to the fundamental terminology and definitions in the field of Artificial Intelligence. The fill-in-the-blank questions (Q1) are a prime example of this. This type of question aims to ensure that the student has grasped the basic terms that form the cornerstone of understanding AI. For instance, questions asking for the definition of "Turing Test," "Agent," or "Agent function" illustrate this approach.

**Examples from Fill-in-the-Blank Questions (Q1) and their Lecture Connections:**

*   **Question:** The ______________ tries to define what acting like a human means.
    *   **Expected Answer:** Turing Test [1].
    *   **Reference:** AI_introCh1.pdf, page 6, where the Turing Test is explained as a method to determine if a machine can behave like a human.

*   **Question:** An ______________ is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators.
    *   **Expected Answer:** Agent [2].
    *   **Reference:** AI_agentsCh2.pdf, page 3, where the definition of an intelligent agent is introduced. This concept is fundamental and is introduced at the beginning of the lectures related to agents.

*   **Question:** The ______________ maps from the set of all possible percept sequences P* to the set of actions A formulated as an abstract mathematical function.
    *   **Expected Answer:** Agent function [2].
    *   **Reference:** AI_agentsCh2.pdf, page 4, where the agent function is defined as a mapping from percept sequences to actions.

*   **Question:** ______________ environment provides a fixed number of distinct percepts, actions, and environment states.
    *   **Expected Answer:** Discrete [1].
    *   **Reference:** AI_introCh1.pdf, page 18, where environments are classified into discrete and continuous.

*   **Question:** An agent operating by itself in an environment is called ______________.
    *   **Expected Answer:** Single agent [1].
    *   **Reference:** AI_introCh1.pdf, page 18, where single-agent and multi-agent environments are distinguished.

*   **Question:** Type of Agents:
    *   **Expected Answer:** Simple reflex, Model-based reflex, Goal-based, Utility-based [2].
    *   **Reference:** AI_agentsCh2.pdf, page 22, where the hierarchy of agent types is presented.

*   **Question:** Search problem components are:
    *   **Expected Answer:** Initial state, Actions, Transition model, Goal state, Path cost [3].
    *   **Reference:** AI_searchCh3.pdf, page 5, where the components of a search problem are detailed.

*   **Question:** ______________ is the number of different states the agent and environment can be in. (State Space)
    *   **Expected Answer:** State Space [3].
    *   **Reference:** AI_searchCh3.pdf, page 21, where the state space is defined.

*   **Question:** In ______________ the search algorithm/agent is not provided information about how close a state is to the goal state.
    *   **Expected Answer:** Uninformed Search [3].
    *   **Reference:** AI_searchCh3.pdf, page 28, where uninformed search is defined.

It is clear that the instructor focuses on these basic definitions and concepts, expecting students to memorize and understand them well. This indicates that a significant portion of the exam may be based on direct recall of information from the lectures.




### 2. Ability for Practical Application (PEAS Question)

The instructor does not stop at theoretical knowledge but also emphasizes the student's ability to apply this knowledge in practical scenarios. The PEAS question for the Automated Taxi Driver (Q2) is a clear example of this approach. This type of question requires the student to go beyond merely memorizing definitions and to think critically about how to apply the PEAS framework to a real-world problem.

**Analysis of the PEAS question for the Automated Taxi Driver (Q2):**

*   **Performance measure:** Requires the student to identify the criteria by which the performance of an automated taxi driver can be evaluated. Possible answers include: safety (avoiding accidents), speed (reaching the destination as quickly as possible), legality (obeying traffic laws and speed limits), passenger comfort, and maximizing profits (reducing fuel consumption and increasing the number of trips).

*   **Environment:** Requires the student to describe the environment in which the automated taxi driver operates. Possible answers include: roads, other traffic, pedestrians, customers, traffic lights, and weather conditions.

*   **Actuators:** Requires the student to identify the tools the automated taxi driver uses to affect the environment. Possible answers include: steering wheel, accelerator pedal, brake, turn signals, horn, and display screen.

*   **Sensors:** Requires the student to identify the tools the automated taxi driver uses to perceive the environment. Possible answers include: cameras, sonar, speedometer, Global Positioning System (GPS), odometer, and engine sensors.

This question demonstrates that the instructor wants students to be able to analyze real-world problems and identify their basic components using the theoretical frameworks they have learned. This suggests that the exam may include other application-based questions that require students to analyze different scenarios and apply the appropriate concepts to them.

### 3. Deep Understanding of Algorithms (Detailed Explanation Questions)

The third part of the exam (Q3) focuses on a deep understanding of algorithms. This type of question requires the student to be able to explain how an algorithm works, its properties, its applications, and possibly write its code. This indicates that the instructor is not satisfied with superficial knowledge but wants students to be able to analyze algorithms thoroughly.

**Analysis of the Iterative Deepening Search (IDS) question (Q3a):**

*   **Explanation of how IDS works:** Requires the student to explain that IDS is a search algorithm that combines the advantages of Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS). IDS works by performing a series of depth-limited searches, increasing the search depth each time. This ensures that it finds the shortest solution (like BFS) while using less memory (like DFS).

*   **Illustrative example:** The student can use a simple search tree to illustrate how IDS works. For example, they can show how IDS will explore the tree at successive levels (0, 1, 2, ...) until it finds the solution.

*   **Properties of IDS:**
    *   **Completeness:** Yes, IDS is complete, meaning it will always find a solution if one exists.
    *   **Optimality:** Yes, IDS is optimal if the cost of each step is equal, because it finds the shortest solution.
    *   **Time Complexity:** O(b^d), where b is the branching factor and d is the depth of the solution.
    *   **Space Complexity:** O(bd), which is much better than BFS.

*   **Writing the algorithm or code:** The student can write a simple code snippet illustrating how to implement IDS, or describe the algorithm in text.

This question demonstrates that the instructor expects students to be able to analyze algorithms comprehensively, understanding their properties and applications. This suggests that the exam may include other questions that require the analysis of different algorithms, such as BFS, DFS, or informed search algorithms.

### 4. Beyond the Provided Content (Uncovered Questions)

It is noted that some questions in the exam (such as Genetic Algorithm, Apriori, and K-Nearest Neighbors) do not directly align with the content provided in the three attached lectures. This suggests several possibilities:

*   **The instructor may rely on other sources:** There might be a prescribed textbook or other resources that students are expected to study.
*   **These lectures might be part of a broader curriculum:** There might be other lectures covering these topics that were not provided.
*   **The instructor might expect students to conduct self-research:** The instructor might encourage students to research these concepts themselves and expand their knowledge.

This means that students should be prepared to research concepts not directly covered in the lectures and have a broad understanding of the field of Artificial Intelligence. This indicates that the instructor values initiative and self-learning and expects students to be active seekers of knowledge.
